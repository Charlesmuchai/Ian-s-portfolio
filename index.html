        <p>Let me tell you a little about me and my personal background and life. I was born in a liitle town called Nairobi
            where my dad worked with the government as a trademark registrar. I went to a small primary school called St.James
            Primary School. I know you might be wondering why everything was so small in my life. That was generally my life
            . There wasnt much to anticipate for everyday because evrything was so substandard and life was boring all the same
            . I soon finished my primary school with quite some good marks. I wont mention them but they were good enough to land me to a
            good national school. So thats how life went by so fast and soon enough i was almost leaving high school.I did my KCPE
             and attained a grade C+. That is when i realised that my biggest dream was almost coming true. Joining a coding school.
            Not just a coding school but a good coding and programming school. And that is when i met Moringa School! Life has changed
            ever since because ive learnt alot. You can go to my projects section to see what ive done so far
